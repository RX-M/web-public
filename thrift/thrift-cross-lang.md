## Building Cross-language Services with Apache Thrift

This training course provides a comprehensive introduction to the Apache Thrift cross-language serialization and RPC framework. Attendees will learn how to design robust and extensible services using the flexible Thrift IDL. Type and service design are covered in detail along with the implementation details necessary to bring interfaces to life. Attendees will learn how to use the Thrift IDL compiler to rapidly generate applications in a range of languages.

Prebuilt Apache Thrift RPC servers are described in detail along with Thrift client objects in both synchronous and asynchronous forms. Attendees will learn how to extend Thrift through custom layered and endpoint transports as well as proprietary protocols and servers. Common pitfalls and design best practices are covered in depth. Lab sessions make use of the client’s preferred language suite, ensuring that students walk away from this course with pragmatic cross-language examples and hands-on experience with their actual application development languages.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
