<!-- CKAD Self-Study Mod 3 -->

In this module of the RX-M online CKS prep course, we will be covering the topics under the **System Hardening** domain identified by the [CNCF CKS Exam Curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKS_Curriculum_%20v1.26.pdf). If you are not already familiar with the curriculum, take a moment to familiarize yourself, as you will be required to know each of the topics in order to pass the test.
