<!-- CKA Self-Study Mod 2 -->

In this module of the RX-M online CKA prep course we will be covering the workloads and scheduling topics identified by the [CNCF CKA Exam Curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_v1.26.pdf). If you are not already familiar with the curriculum, take a moment to familiarize yourself, as you will be required to know each of the topics in order to pass the test.
