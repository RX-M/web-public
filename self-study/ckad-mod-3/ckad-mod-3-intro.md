<!-- CKAD Self-Study Mod 3 -->

In this module of the RX-M online CKAD prep course we will be covering the application environment, configuration, and security topics identified by the [CNCF CKAD Exam Curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKAD_Curriculum_V1.30.pdf). If you are not already familiar with the curriculum, take a moment to familiarize yourself, as you will be required to know each of the topics in order to pass the test.
