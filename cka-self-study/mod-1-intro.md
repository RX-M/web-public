<!-- CKA Self-Study Mod 1 -->

In this module of the RX-M online CKA prep course we will be covering the scheduling, logging, and monitoring topics
identified by the [CNCF CKA Exam Curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_V1.17.pdf).
If you are not already familiar with the curriculum, take a moment to familiarize yourself, as you will be required to
know each of the topics in order to pass the test.
