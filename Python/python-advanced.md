## Advanced Python Programming

This Python training course continues from where RX-M's Python Essentials course leaves off, covering some topics in more detail, and adding many new ones, with a focus on enterprise development. This is a hands-on programming class; all concepts are reinforced by informal practice during the lecture, followed by lab exercises. Many labs build on earlier labs, which help students retain the earlier material. 

All attendees will learn to use Python to leverage OS services, create modules, create and run unit tests, define classes, interact with network services, query databases and process XML data.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for in-person and virtual delivery.
