## RESTful Web Services – Principles and Best Practices Seminar

This seminar provides architects, analysts, developers and other technical staff with a comprehensive overview of core RESTful architecture principles, design approaches and best practices. Training begins with a detailed look at the REST architectural style, examining why the web works and how it scales. These foundations are then expanded to present the RESTful service concept and its goals. 

Important concepts including resource oriented architectures, resource based modeling, the Richardson Maturity Model and decoupling clients and servers through HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) are covered in depth. Attendees will leave the seminar with a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of RESTful services, an overview of best practice patterns and antipatterns as well as familiarity with the design areas in which debate still ensues in the community.
