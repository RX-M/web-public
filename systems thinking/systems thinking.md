This 2 day hands on training course will teach attendees how to put systems thinking to use in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of complex systems. Attendees will learn how to use various techniques to study and understand an array of systems. The course covers topics such as requirements engineering, reliability, logistics, cross team coordination, testing, evaluation and maintainability in the context of systems thinking. Attendees will learn how to address technical and human-centered disciplines in areas of engineering, organizational dynamics and project management. A particular focus is placed on identifying the aspects of a project or system which should be considered and integrated into a whole as well as work-process optimization and risk management. Attendees will become familiar with the systems thinking discovery process which empowers teams to identify the real problems that need to be resolved, and the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur, bringing these insights together to form elegant solutions.
