## Advanced C Programming

This course provides practicing C programmers a deeper understanding of the more advanced aspects of the C language and focuses on sophisticated and practical topics. Covered during the course are topics such as: the evolution of the C language; details of program structure and the nature of scope, storage class and type in C; memory management features and best practices; internals of the stream and file based I/O elements of C; process security and proper buffer management; data structures and supporting C derived types; and aspects of parallel execution including threading and locking. 

Attendees will be exposed to generic, functional and object-oriented programming strategies and will learn an advanced collection of practical build, test and application profiling techniques in a series of hands-on labs designed to provide practical experience with the covered material.

This is an Instructor-Led-Training (ILT) training class and is available for in-person and virtual delivery.
