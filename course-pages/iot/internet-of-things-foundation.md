<!-- Internet of Things (IoT) Foundation -->

This course introduces engineers and technical staff to the Internet of Things (IoT) through a combination of theory and
practical applications. This three-day intensive training class is hands-on, giving students a chance to explore various
aspects of IoT technology. The course begins with an orientation to the IoT space and the most important technologies in
play. The course progresses through foundational concepts such as microcontrollers, radios, networks, and sensors with a
range of discussions and experiments to deepen understanding. The course then moves to the cloud to examine a range of
backend and distribution/gateway technologies. The open-source Little Iot Agent (LIoTA) platform is examined as a case
study and in hands-on lab work. Upon course completion, attendees will have a broad, yet practical understanding of IoT
and the IoT space.
