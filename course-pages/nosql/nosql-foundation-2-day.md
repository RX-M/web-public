<!-- NoSQL Foundation 2 Day -->

NoSQL Foundation is a 2 day course which takes attendees on an in-depth tour of the world of NoSQL from a data design perspective. The course covers the basic architecture and use cases around the most popular NoSQL storage solutions: Key/Value, Document, Column Family, Graph and multi-model; however, the storage engines are covered from the vantage of a data engineer. Each module of the course discusses key data design concerns and considerations. Attendees are introduced to general schema on read principles, the CAP theorem, consistency techniques, read and write quorums, eventual consistency, aggregate design, aggregate evolution, key design and selection, vertical and horizontal partitioning, partition pruning, denormalization, and much more.

Upon completion DBAs and data engineers will be prepared to design effective data solutions for modern NoSQL and Cloud Native environments.


### Delivery

NoSQL Foundation is available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend

Data Engineers, Data Architects, DBAs, Developers, DevOps, and Technical Staff.


### What Attendees will learn

NoSQL Foundation is designed to provide technical personnel with an in depth look at the nature of NoSQL storage solutions and the data design considerations that ensure proper operation, efficiency and scaling when using them.

- NoSQL Overview
-	Data and distribution models
- Key-Value, document, and column-family stores
- Graph database


### Prerequisites

Attendees must have experience working with some type of database (typically a relational database). All students will need to be able to ssh to a provided cloud instance. If ssh isn't available due to security concerns, arrangements can be made.
