<!-- NoSQL Foundation -->

This NoSQL training course provides technical staff with a comprehensive introduction to NoSQL and NewSQL data models, architectures and products. Training begins with a look at the evolution of data storage, highlighting the shortfall presented by ACID type relational systems in an increasingly distributed world. Alternative data models are examined in detail providing an array of alternatives, each solving specific problems.

Data distribution and consistency models are explored in the context of the CAP theorem. The data theory covered on day one is studied in practical terms on day two. The principle NoSQL database systems are examined in turn, including document, key-value, column-family and graph systems. The course also examines the reentrance of SQL as an optional modular layer in several NoSQL systems.
