<!-- Docker Swarm -->

This one-day hands-on course is designed to provide Docker users comprehensive coverage of Docker's native orchestration tool, Docker Swarm. The course begins with an introduction to the Docker Swarm architecture followed by a lab which configures a small Swarm cluster. Nodes and node configurations are covered, introducing attendees to managers and workers the Raft and Gossip protocols and various docker commands for working with clusters. The new Distributed Application Bundle (DAB) image format is covered along with stacks, services, tasks, nodes, and other Docker Swarm primitives. Docker services are covered in-depth, including replicated and global service operation, scaling features, tasks, task states, the Docker service routing mesh, services discovery, and failover.

Upon completion of this intensive hands-on course, students will have an in-depth understanding of Swarm and its use cases, as well as the ability to immediately begin using Swarm in development, test and production scenarios.
