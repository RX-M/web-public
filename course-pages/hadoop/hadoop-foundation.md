<!-- Hadoop Foundation -->

This hands-on Hadoop training course teaches Data Analysts, BI Analysts, BI Developers, SAS Developers and other types of analysts who need to answer questions and analyze Big Data stored in a Hadoop cluster how to develop applications and analyze Big Data stored in Apache Hadoop using Hive. Students will learn the details of Hadoop, YARN, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), an overview of MapReduce, and a deep dive into using Hive to perform data analytics on Big Data.

Students will work through lab exercises using the Hortonworks Data Platform for Windows to issue HDFS commands to add/remove files and folders from HDFS, run and monitor MapReduce jobs, retrieve HCatalog schemas from within a Pig script, perform a join of datasets and use advanced Hive features like windowing, views and multi-file inserts.
