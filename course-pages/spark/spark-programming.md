<!-- Apache Spark Programming -->

This Apache Spark training course is for data engineers, analysts, architects, software engineers, IT operations and technical managers interested in a thorough, hands-on overview of Apache Spark and SparkSQL. The course covers the core APIs for using Spark; fundamental mechanisms and basic internals of the platform; SQL and other high-level data access tools; as well as Spark’s streaming capabilities and machine learning APIs.

Each topic includes lecture content along with hands-on use of Spark in lab exercises. Attendees will code jobs and perform data analysis queries, and visualizations using their own Spark cluster. All class code is directly usable with pure open-source Spark or any commercial Spark distribution.
