<!-- Azure Foundation -->

This in-depth hands-on course introduces technology staff to the wide range of core features offered by the Microsoft Azure cloud. The course is organized into three main topic areas, IaaS, Application Services and Big Data features. Day one introduces the foundational infrastructure services offered by Azure. Through lecture, discussion and hands on labs, attendees will learn how to work with cloud compute instances, block storage devices and virtual networks. The course covers a range of use cases and highlights the advantages and drawbacks associated with running cloud based workloads. Object storage and other ancillary IaaS services are also examined at various levels of detail.

Day two builds upon day one by adding discussion and lab work around application support services. Attendees will learn how Azure load balancers and application gateways can be used to expose applications over the Internet. The course continues with a discussion of global DNS services and Azure content delivery network features. The last day two modules introduce the various hosted SQL and NoSQL database solutions offered by the Azure cloud.

Day three focuses on the big data services offered by Azure. Key data analysis and processing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark are examined along with big data storage facilities and both batch and stream-based machine learning and analytics processing solutions. Each module is complemented by a hands-on lab giving students practical experience with the technology under discussion. Upon completion, attendees will have the knowledge and skills necessary to begin planning moves to and working with services on, the Microsoft Azure cloud.
