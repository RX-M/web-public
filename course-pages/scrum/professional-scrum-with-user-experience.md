Professional Scrum™ with User Experience (PSU) is a 2-day hands-on course where students who already have a fundamental understanding of Scrum and some experience using it will learn how to integrate modern UX practices into the way they are working in Scrum and how to work most effectively within Scrum Teams. Design work can sometimes feel slow, and not well suited to quick agile cadences and Scrum events, but that isn't the case. Learn UX techniques that fit beautifully into Scrum, and practice these techniques with cross-functional teams in class.


### Delivery

Professional Scrum™ with User Experience training is available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Created in Partnership with the Authors of Lean UX

 Scrum.org and our Professional Scrum Trainers have worked with Jeff Gothelf and Joshua Seiden the authors of the book Lean UX in the creation of this course, leveraging their expertise and knowledge.


### Who Should Attend

Scrum Masters and Product Owners who will learn how to integrate the UX specialty with what they already know about the power of self-organizing cross-functional teams . This will enable them to help Development Teams to learn about the customer, plan learning/discovery/design work, and still deliver "Done" product each Sprint.
People who know UX will learn how to work more effectively inside Scrum, managing work in Sprints and visualizing it in the Product Backlog. Learn how to lead cross-functional teams in discovery work and align the work of the team around learning and delivering value to users.

Anyone involved in the delivering the product (engineers, product managers, etc) as technology teams work better when they’re collaborating across disciplines and specialties. But different priorities, types of work, and the specific working rhythms of each discipline can create silos on teams and inside organizations. Learn how to use the Scrum framework and UX techniques to align your team, focus on value, and foster collaboration.


### What Attendees will learn

Over the 2 days, students will learn UX techniques that work most effectively with Scrum Teams. In addition, you will learn practical tools and practices to best work with customers and their feedback to deliver higher value in the customer's eyes with Scrum Teams without changing Scrum.

Students will leave the class understanding how to reconcile UX work with Scrum essentials like the Definition of "Done", Backlog ordering and delivering "Done" Increments every Sprint.  You will learn how to handle design work that may extend beyond a single Sprint, continuing to deliver value each and every Sprint using Scrum.
