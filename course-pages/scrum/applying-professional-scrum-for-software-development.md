Applying Professional Scrum™ for Software Development (APS-SD) is a 3-day hands-on course where students experience how to deliver quality software using Scrum with Agile and DevOps practices. Students work in Scrum Teams over a series of Sprints, creating code on a realistic software system to learn Scrum while using Scrum. The course, formerly known as Professional Scrum Developer, includes a free attempt at the globally recognized Professional Scrum Developer I certification exam (PSD I).

Over the 3 days, students gain a real-world view of what it is like to build software with Scrum. They collaborate over a series of Sprints applying modern engineering practices, and using the Scrum framework to manage complexity. The key focus of the class is on how to develop and deliver increments of releasable functionality. Students will experience real-world challenges and issues, and through a series of Sprints will learn how to continuously improve the way they perform their work.

The course teaches how Agile engineering practices and supportive DevOps tools complement Scrum and further advance a team's capabilities.

The course is available in .NET and Java specific technologies, along with a generic technology course. Professional Scrum Trainers can work with you to define a specific technology stack that meets your needs in private classes for your organization.

The .NET version was developed in partnership with Microsoft® and is the official training solution for Microsoft Visual Studio.


### Delivery

Applying Professional Scrum™ for Software development training is available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend

The APS for Software Development course is intended for all members of a Scrum Team involved in developing and delivering software based systems including: architects, analysts, programmers, database developers, testers, managers, IT-Operations and others, including Scrum Masters and Product Owners.

This course provides greatest value if the whole Scrum Team (Developers, Scrum Master and Product Owner) attend together and experience the power of real teamwork. Teams that attend together are not only able to apply learnings to their work immediately, but are also able to recall their classroom experiences to overcome particularly challenging times.

Of course, this class is also valuable to individuals attending without their entire team. These students will experience working on a Scrum Team during the class and will be able to transfer their learnings to their teammates, often convincing their teammates of the advantages of using Scrum, Agile and DevOps practices.

Topics covered in the  course include:

- The Scrum Framework
- Working within a Scrum Team
- Definition of Done
