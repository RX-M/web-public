<!-- Securing Kubernetes -->

Our securing Kubernetes course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the processes and practices around securing Kubernetes including application and image security, logging, network policy/segmentation, Kubernetes control plane security and auditing, and RBAC configuration.

This intensive two-day hands-on course is designed to provide working platform operators and other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to the processes and practices around securing Kubernetes. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of Kubernetes and container-based security concerns. Day one focuses on foundational security concerns including securing cloud native applications, container isolation, image security, and network policy/segmentation. On day two students will gain hands-on experience with Kubernetes authentication, control plane security, etcd security as well as RBAC configuration and management. The class concludes with a look at keylogging and metrics monitoring as well as Kubernetes security auditing features. Upon completion of the course, attendees will have the skills and information necessary to effectively secure a production-grade Kubernetes cluster.


### Delivery

Available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend

Site/Service Reliability Engineers (SRE), Information Technology (IT) Staff, Platform Operators, Technical Managers, DevOps Personnel


### What Attendees will learn

This course is designed to provide operators with a comprehensive overview of Kubernetes security. Learning modules include:

- Cloud native application security
- Securing the Kubernetes control plane
- Kubernetes authentication, authorization, and role based access control (RBAC)
- Kubernetes attack vectors
- Kubernetes observability: logging, metrics, auditing, audit policies



### Prerequisites

Students should have taken the RX-M “Kubernetes Foundation” course or have equivalent knowledge. Each attendee must provide their own laptop with the ability to run a 64 bit virtual machine (alternatively a cloud based lab environment can be provided for a nominal fee). Unconstrained internet access is also required to complete the labs.
