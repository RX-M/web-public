<!-- Secure Development on Kubernetes -->

This intensive two-day hands-on course is designed to provide developers and other technology professionals with a
comprehensive look at principles and practices for secure application development and deployment on the Kubernetes platform.
The course covers the many new attack vectors present in orchestrated container systems and describes key mitigation
techniques used to protect the supply chain and the runtime environment. Through lectures and extensive hands-on labs,
students will gain experience securing container images, locking down runtime environments, creating least privilege
deployments and zero trust networking configurations. Upon completion, attendees will have the skills and information
necessary to build and deploy secure containerized applications in a Kubernetes setting.
