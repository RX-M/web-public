<!-- Cryptography in Cloud Native Systems-->


Cryptography in Cloud Native Systems is an in-depth three day hands-on course introduces developers, security professionals and other technology staff to the principles and practices driving modern cryptography.

Upon completion, attendees will have the knowledge and skills necessary to create and analyze best practice driven
cryptographic systems that are  robust, efficient and secure.


### Delivery

Cryptography in Cloud Native Systems training is available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend

Developers, InfoSec and CyberSec Professionals, IT and QA Staff, Architects, and Technical Managers may all benefit from the understanding of Cryptography, and its application in cloud native systems, offered by this course.


### What Attendees will learn

Day one begins with a cryptography overview and coverage of both block and stream ciphers. Block cipher modes for streaming systems are covered along with schemes for encryption at rest, both on-prem and in the cloud.


Day two ties in hashing and signing technologies along with keys and key exchange. On the practical side, day two introduces attendees to certificates, PKI, TLS, IPSEC, WPA2 and various MAC and digital signature schemes used to authenticate binaries and containers. Each module in the course includes a hands-on lab, giving attendees a chance to work with common  tools and technologies, providing practical insight to accompany the theory.


Day three introduces various key management schemes and tools such as Hashi Corp Vault and common cloud native platform solutions. The final sections cover authentication and encryption platforms such as Kerberos, OAUTH, SAML OpenID Connect and JWT.


### Prerequisites

A general technology background is desirables for participants to excel in this course. Each attendee must have a laptop with internet access.
