<!-- Value Stream Management Foundation (DevOps Institute) -->

The Value Stream Management Foundation course is an introduction to value stream management (VSM) principles, practices, and tools. The Value Stream Management Foundation course from Value Stream Management Consortium, and offered in partnership with DevOps Institute, takes learners through a value stream management implementation journey. It considers the human, process, and technology aspects of this way of working and explores how optimizing value streams for flow and realization positively impacts organizational performance. Digital value streams include the software applications and services in addition to the platforms that support them (e.g., cloud infrastructure or DevOps toolchains).
