<!-- Microservice Foundation-->

Microservice Foundation is an intensive three-day hands-on course is designed to provide working developers, DevOps staff and other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to microservices and microservices application architecture. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of microservices and how to maximize them in cloud native systems. Students will gain hands on experience working with microservices and platform tools during lab sessions following each of the twelve modules in the course. The course covers microservice design principles and best practices, anti patterns, the distinction between web apps and backend microservices, the use of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Cloud as a Service (CaaS) systems, the benefits of container packaging and container registries, as well as dynamic application management using orchestration tools and service meshes. Attendees will examine various use cases and architecture patterns for microservice based applications throughout the course, with focused discussion on microservice communications, transactions, state decomposition and state management. Upon completion of the course attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin designing and working with microservice based applications in a practical setting.


### Delivery

 Microservice Foundation training is available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend

- Microservice principles and best practices
- How microservices communicate
- Container Packaging
- Polyglot Persistence
- How to migrate from an existing monolith
- Microservice orchestration
