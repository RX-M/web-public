<!-- Go Advanced -->

This course delves into the conceptual and practical aspects of coding efficiently in Go. In this intensive three-day
hands-on course, engineers will learn how to coding naturally in Go, using the language as it was intended to solve
problems using Go centric idioms. The course deals with the most important advanced features of Go programing  and
discusses best practices throughout. Day one begins with Go idioms and common Go programming constructs, followed by
coverage of advanced function and method usage. The communicating sequential processes model, goroutines, channels and
concurrency are also explored, followed by a look at testing and profiling Go programs. Upon completion, attendees will
leave with a clear understanding of the more advanced features of the Go programming language and ways to best utilize
Go to solve problems in an idiomatic fashion, using the features of the language to build direct, correct, safe and easy
to maintain software.
