<!-- ArangoDB-->

The ArangoDB course is offered as a two day hands-on course where participants will learn a comprehensive introduction to the ArangoDB multi-model database. As a multi-model database, some may find ArangoDB is initially surprising in the amount of flexibility offered.


### Delivery

ArangoDB training is available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend

This course is intended for DBAs, Data Engineers, Developers, IT and QA Staff, Technical Managers, DevOps, and SRE personnel.


### What Attendees will learn

Day one begins with an overview of the ArangoDB database where each student will setup and configure their own ArangoDB cluster for testing. Each module thereafter is accompanied by additional hands on labs, giving attendees practical experience with ArangoDB as they progress. Day one continues with coverage of the Arango query language, graph database/query concepts and basic database operations. Day two carries on with more in-depth topics including: database architecture, data design best practices, incremental and bulk data operations, as well as extending ArangoDB with Foxx style embedded JavaScript microservices. Upon completion, attendees will have a solid understanding of ArangoDB and the skill necessary to begin working with ArangoDB in a production setting.


### Prerequisites

Each attendee will require the ability to ssh into a cloud lab instance (provided with the course). Basic Linux command
line skills are valuable but not required.
