### Pricing

RX-M is based in the United States of America. Unless otherwise noted, all prices listed are in United States Dollars ($ USD).


### Student Reschedule or Cancellation

A full refund will be issued for class cancellations made at least 21 calendar days prior to the course start date (first day of class).

Payment is non-refundable for cancellations or reschedules made within 21 calendar days from the course start date and for **No-Shows** (students who do not attend class).

For reschedules made within 21 calendar days from the course start date, students must reschedule immediately for a current, published course, up to a maximum of six months from the original date.

If the course registration was purchased in conjunction with a promotion or special program, a pro-rated refund will be issued to account for paid services received by the student.

Notifications for cancellation and reschedules must be provided in writing to RX-M ([info@rx-m.com](mailto:info@rx-m.com)).


### Student Substitutions

Student substitutions are allowed with at least 5 calendar days prior to the class delivery start date, provided the substitute meets the course prerequisites or is approved by RX-M. Substitute students will be bound to the same Terms and Conditions of the original registration.


### RX-M Reschedule or Cancellation

RX-M reserves the right to reschedule or cancel training course deliveries. If it is necessary for RX-M to reschedule or cancel a class, a two-week notice is normally provided. RX-M is not responsible for non-refundable travel fees incurred.

If a student cannot attend an alternative course date for an RX-M initiated reschedule or cancellation, a refund will be issued.


### Facilities and Catering

For on-site engagements, RX-M uses reasonable efforts to contract with reputable facilities and catering providers for the health and safety of our clients and staff. RX-M shall neither be responsible for, nor bear any liability whatsoever regarding, any injuries, illnesses, damages of any kind that may result from or arise out of food consumption at any event, or otherwise be liable for the quality or fitness of any food and drink.
