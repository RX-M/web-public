## Test Driven Development Fundamentals

This intensive two-day hands-on training course is designed to provide working developers, QE staff and other software professionals with a comprehensive introduction to Test Driven Development. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the benefits associated with driving the development process with tests and testing.

Students will gain hands-on experience with the principles discussed in each chapter using Java and common testing tools such as JUnit, Cucumber for Java and Jenkins. The course focuses on principles and practices rather than construction, thus students will come to grips with the reasons and motivation for TDD. Lab experiments provide crisp demonstrations of the value proposition associated with driving software design and construction through test.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
